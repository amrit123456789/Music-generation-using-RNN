# Music-generation-using-RNN
Implemented a model that uses an LSTM to generate music

# Things Learnt:
-Apply an LSTM to music generation.
-Generate your own jazz music with deep learning

# Conclusions:
-A sequence model can be used to generate musical values, which are then post-processed into midi music.
-Fairly similar models can be used to generate dinosaur names or to generate music, with the major difference being the input fed to the model.
-In Keras, sequence generation involves defining layers with shared weights, which are then repeated for the different time steps  1,…,Tx1,…,Tx .
